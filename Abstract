The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of pre-trained
language models (LLMs) in translating Bengali to English. We manually created a
dataset of 200 Bengali-English sentence pairs, classified by sentence length and
type, to provide a diverse range of translation scenarios. Various foundational
models, including LLAMA, Gemma3 Bhasini, and at least ten other models from
Hugging Face, were utilized for translation. The performance of these models was
evaluated using standard machine translation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE,
to compare the quality of translations with human-generated references. This
project aims to identify the best-performing models for Bengali-English translation
and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different models in capturing
linguistic nuances.
